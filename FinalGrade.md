# Final Grade
## Why I deserve an A!

Throughout this course I have faced many challenges, from learning R to getting to get creative freedom as to what this project even entails. Overall I do think this has been a very interesting course and I have learned a lot that will help me in my future as a Statistician. I have learned more than just all of the learning objectives. I have learned to work with someone who is not in my major on projects and through that I have learned that when working as a team we each have our strengths and weaknesses that help us in the end have an even better result, because we can lean on each other when we need help. 

I deserve an A in this class because I feel like I have really grown as a data person based off of what I have said in the Growth as a Data person essay. I have also learned a lot about R and not only completed the learning objectives I have gone above the bare minimum that is asked for. For example, I did not just create a graph I went and modified it to make it easier to read and more attractive to the eye. For every learning objective I have an example like this that can be found in my learning objectives reflections. 

Another reason as to why I believe I deserve an A is because during class Cymbre and I worked well on collaborating and worked through obstacles together and when we did get stuck we would be fine reaching out to Bradford. I think this is another valuable skill and reason as to why I deserve an A, because collaboration is something that will be needed in every aspect of life.

One last reason to make note of as to why I deserve an A is to look at where I started in May. In May I had no knowledge of Github, R, or really any other programming language other than SAS. Now I can confidently say that I have a pretty good understanding of Github and R! I now know how to create a good looking Github repository that is easy for people to understand and look through and I now know how to effectively have R and Github to communicate effectively.
