# Completed Objectives
## Learning Objectives
### Import, manage, and clean data:
- Import: My data file is an excel data file which I have to import into R. I did this by using the library readxl, then importing my data using dataset <- read_excel("jonestown_new.xlsx") on my Shiny app. 
- Manage: In order to create a heatmap of where everyone was born I am going to have to use a States datafile, which will combine more that one data source.
- Clean Data: Some of the data is not clean or useful when completing my shiny app. For example for gender it was considered different categagories for f and F. I had to go in manually and change this so all variables shared the same case. 
### Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations:
- Creating Graphical displays: This is occuring in my Shiny App. My Shiny app displays many different bar chart to show a graphical display of multiple different variables. 
- Creating Numerical Summaries: I can use frequency tables in my analysis of my research questions and present my findings. I started off completing my project by creating frequency tables to see what the data could tell me just based off of those. 
### Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments:
- My randomization occured within my shiny app I created. I created an interactive model where the user can select which variable they would like to see a bar chart for. From there the app works behind the scenese to creat a bar chart to display data for whatever variable was selected.
### Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs:
- I have been demonstrating this by being able to ask my teammate for help on certain issues, but I have also been able to within a few google searches find the resolution to any problems that have occured so far in this class. I have also been reaching out to Bradford whenever I am stuck on a topic. 
### Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs:
- I plan on following good coding teqnique by having comments explaining what I have done. I also plan on having seperate sections for the seperate graphics I have made (For example: I have been seperating sections and labeling for my seperate frequency tables)
