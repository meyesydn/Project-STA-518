# Project-STA-518
## Abstract
In this portfolio you will find my work and reflections that I have created to show my skills that I have learned in STA 518. I decided to focus on the tragic massacre that happened in Jonestown. I have created a Shiny App that displays an interactive bar chart to help visualize the data. I have also created multiple frequency tables in order to help answer some of my research questions.
