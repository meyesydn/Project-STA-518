# Project STA 518
## Overview
For this project I plan on looking at the data from Jonestown. Some information on Jonestown is that Jonestown was a massacre that occured on November 18th, 1978. This is one of the most famous massacres that has ever taken place and had 918 victims. I will be taking a look at the demographics of the members of this community in order to answer some research questions I have came up with. 

I do understand that these are real people that this has happened to, so I do plan on being as respectful as possible.


## Research Questions
What birth state is seen the most frequently in Jonestown?

What age group was seen the most?

What ethnicity was the most common?

Is there a vast difference in Gender from Jonestown? (only male or female is given on the dataset)

## Visualizations
I was thinking about creating a heat map for what state has the most members who were apart of Jonestown. The purpose of this would be able to look at the frequency of birth states
I also would like to create some sort of frequency table or histogram to show the most common age groups that were found in Jonestown.

## Goals
- To use this data to understand ggplot and other R features. 
- Creating multiple different types of visulaizations.
- To answer my research questions that I have created. 

## Why am I interested in this project
I am interested in this project because first of all I have looked at this data set for a little bit previously to this project, but all in all I find Jonestown quite tragic and interesting. I am also interested in this project, because this is something I have done before, but in SAS. I have been given dataset and asked to analyze them and see if I can see any trends between, race, age, sex, and etc. I think having the opportunity to analyze a dataset in R would be extremely benefitial for me and my furture!
