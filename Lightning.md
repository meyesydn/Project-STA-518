# Lightning Round:
## What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.
- The hardest part of class for me at the moment is the R code. This is pretty general and I am sure most of people's problems but R does confuse me, which is normal because it is a new language! I do think I have a pretty good understanding of Github and Markdown, which is a victory for me!
## What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why.
- So far nothing has been super easy for me! I have struggled with most things, but talking and working with my teammate has helped me work through problems.
## What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.
- What has interested me the most is the communication between Github and R. I think it is very cool.
## Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a semester of STA 418/518 that will help them be successful in learning.
- Advice that I would give a STA 418/518 student for beginning the semester is to stay on top of things. Definitely do NOT miss the first few weeks of class! That is when we learn a lot of the beginning set up stuff for R and Github which is something that you definitely need to know!
