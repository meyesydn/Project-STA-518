# Lightning Round:
## What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.
- The hardest part of class for me at the moment is the R code, specifically shiny apps. At the midterm reflection I was struggling with all of the code in general, but now I can write code for graphs or frequency tables very quickly.
## What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why.
- So far nothing has been super easy for me! I have struggled with most things, but talking and working with my teammate has helped me work through problems. I would say the easiest part of this class for me is the ability to reach out and get help when I need it. I have had an awesome teammate who I feel is very easy to talk to. I also have felt comfortable reaching out to Bradford whenever I am struggling. 
## What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why.
- What has interested me the most is the communication between Github and R. I think this is interesting, because it is a way to store R code and a place where you can hold final images, writing, tables of contents, and more. Github to me is a place where a data person can display findings and to communicate findings where either a data person and non-data person can find.  
## Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a semester of STA 418/518 that will help them be successful in learning.
- Advice that I would give a STA 418/518 student for beginning the semester is to stay on top of things. Definitely do NOT miss the first few weeks of class! That is when we learn a lot of the beginning set up stuff for R and Github which is something that you definitely need to know!
