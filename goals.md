# Goals to Complete the Objectives
## Learning Objectives
### Import, manage, and clean data:
- Import: My data file is an excel data file which I have to import into R
- Manage: In order to create a heatmap of where everyone was born I am going to have to use a States datafile, which will combine more that one data source.
- Clean Data: Some of the data for example Date of Birth is a Character variable and in order to use that I will need to change it to a numeric variable. My data is also unclean due to issues with capitals. For example male and Male was registering as different variables, so I had to go in and make sure everything was the same case. 
### Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations:
- Creating Graphical displays: This is occuring in my Shiny App. My Shiny app displays many different bar chart to show a graphical display of multiple different variables. 
- Creating Numerical Summaries: I can use frequency tables in my analysis of my research questions and present my findings.
### Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments:
- This is one that I am struggling with because I have a census data not a sample. If I was creating a sample then my randomization technique would be important, but there isn't any randomization that was done with a census of data.
### Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs:
- I have been demonstrating this by being able to ask my teammate for help on certain issues, but I have also been able to within a few google searches find the resolution to any problems that have occured so far in this class. I plan on continuing doing this throughout continuing my project.
### Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs:
- I plan on following good coding teqnique by having comments explaining what I have done. I also plan on having seperate sections for the seperate graphics I have made (For example: different coding section for my frequency table and my heatmap)
