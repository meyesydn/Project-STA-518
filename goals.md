# Goals to Complete the Objectives
## Learning Objectives
### Import, manage, and clean data:
- Import: My data file is an excel data file which I have to import into R
- Manage: In order to create a heatmap of where everyone was born I am going to have to use a States datafile, which will combine more that one data source.
- Clean Data: Some of the data for example Date of Birth is a Character variable and in order to use that I will need to change it to a numeric variable.
### Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations:
- Creating Graphical displays: This will be done by creating my heat map of where all the members of the Jonestown Mascare were born.
- Creating Numerical Summaries: I can use frequency tables in my analysis of my research questions and present my findings.
### Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments:
-
### Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs:
-
### Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs:
-
