# Growth as a Data Person:
So far I feel like I have grown as a data person by learning a new language to start with! I have a good understanding of the Statistics behind everything, so being able to form these graphs on a different coding site that sas has really grown my knowledge! I have also learned that it is frustrating to start and learn a new coding language and thats okay! Learning R has been very confusing and I know that I will only get better the more I work on it and practice. I think another important note to make is that growing as a data person you have to be comfortable asking questions. I have gotten very comfortable reaching out to Bradford and my teammate in order to recieve help on my project and in the class. I do understand that is it okay to be stuck for a moment and try to figure out yourself, but staring at the same code over and over again will not give you the answer, but getting another perspective could help you.
